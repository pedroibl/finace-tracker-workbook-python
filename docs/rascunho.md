**Work Summary**
- Captured cross-role execution brief framing Phase 1 scaffolding requirements from `docs/prd-excell-budget-tracker.md:28`.
- Detailed Phase 2â€“3 core sheet deliverables so backend work tracks the PRD expectations in `docs/prd-excell-budget-tracker.md:351` and `docs/prd-excell-budget-tracker.md:735`.
- Documented QA and documentation gates aligned with `docs/prd-excell-budget-tracker.md:1084` to keep release criteria visible.
- Authored a reusable generator script with defensive I/O handling to build `AGENTS.md` once write access is available.

Given the read-only sandbox I couldnâ€™t create `AGENTS.md`; please drop in the following content at the project root.

# Agent Execution Brief

## Mission
Deliver Python Excel Budget Generator v1.0.0 within the eight-week plan defined in `docs/prd-excell-budget-tracker.md`.

## Key Artifacts
- `docs/prd-excell-budget-tracker.md` â€“ canonical scope, priorities, and validation steps.
- `src/budget_generator/` â€“ production package modules (sheets, formatting, formulas, utils).
- `tests/` â€“ desired unit, integration, and golden-file suites.
- `examples/` â€“ reference JSON specifications for integration validation.

## Roles & Responsibilities
### Project Lead
- Maintain schedule, unblock resources, and drive weekly reviews.
- Track status indicators and adjust scope when blockers arise.
- Coordinate release checklists and stakeholder communication.

### Dev Lead
- Complete Phase 1 scaffolding and dependency work (Sections 1.1â€“1.4).
- Define coding standards, ensure `uv` workflows stay green, and review merge readiness.
- Partner with Backend Dev to decompose Phase 2â€“3 features into actionable tickets.

### Backend Developer
- Implement JSON loader, CLI, generator, and sheet builders (Sections 1.3â€“3.6).
- Maintain formula/named range helpers and ensure advanced dashboard/chart features work.
- Create fixtures and unit tests alongside each module to keep coverage intact.

### QA Engineer
- Build Phase 4 test suites (Sections 4.1â€“4.3) with â‰¥80% coverage and golden-file diffing.
- Automate regression harness (`uv run pytest --cov`), track flakiness, and sign off on release candidates.
- Validate named ranges, formulas, and workbook interoperability across Excel versions.

### Technical Writer
- Produce release-ready README and supporting docs (Section 4.4).
- Capture troubleshooting guidance, CLI reference, and onboarding notes while features land.
- Ensure docs stay in sync with CLI flags, JSON schema, and release packaging instructions.

## Execution Milestones
### Phase 1 â€“ Foundation & Setup (Week 1â€“2)
- [ ] Install `uv`, scaffold repo structure, initialise git, and create baseline metadata.
- [ ] Configure dependencies, CLI entry points, and JSON loader utilities.
- [ ] Deliver workbook generator skeleton and Settings sheet implementation.
- Exit Criteria: `uv run budget-generator --help` succeeds; workbook saves six sheets with correct visibility.

### Phase 2 â€“ Core Sheets (Week 3â€“4)
- [ ] Ship Dropdown Data sheet and named range manager.
- [ ] Build Budget Planning sheet structure, totals, conditional formatting, and accounting styles.
- [ ] Refresh fixtures/tests to cover months, categories, and unallocated calculations.
- Exit Criteria: Planning sheet formulas compute correctly; named ranges resolve inside Excel.

### Phase 3 â€“ Advanced Features (Week 5â€“6)
- [ ] Complete Calculations sheet metrics, month helpers, and budget-vs-tracked table.
- [ ] Implement dashboard selectors, KPI tiles, and doughnut charts.
- [ ] Ensure tracking integrations and cross-sheet formulas stay performant.
- Exit Criteria: Dashboard updates when `DashYear`/`DashPeriod` change; charts render without Excel warnings.

### Phase 4 â€“ Polish & Testing (Week 7â€“8)
- [ ] Achieve comprehensive unit/integration/output validation coverage with â‰¥80% threshold.
- [ ] Finalise documentation, tutorials, and troubleshooting appendix.
- [ ] Dry-run release workflow (build artifacts, changelog, optional PyPI publish) and collect sign-off.
- Exit Criteria: Test suite passes cleanly; README ready; release checklist complete.

## Quality Gates
- Automated tests run via `uv run pytest --cov=budget_generator --cov-report=term`.
- Workbook regression checked against golden files for values, formulas, formatting, and named ranges.
- Manual validation of Excel output on current Microsoft 365 and at least one LibreOffice version.
- All critical tasks reach âœ… status with linked verification commands from the PRD.

## Tooling & Delivery
- Use `uv sync`/`uv run` for environment consistency; pin dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- Adopt feature branch workflow with mandatory reviews and static analysis (black, ruff, mypy).
- Track progress in the project board using the priority/status icons defined in the PRD.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Chart rendering support in openpyxl â†’ prototype early; fallback to alternative visualization if blocked.
- Complex SUMPRODUCT/CHOOSE formulas â†’ cover with focused unit tests and integration fixtures.
- Hidden sheet visibility bugs â†’ include assertions in integration tests and golden comparisons.
- Late schedule slips â†’ maintain buffer by finishing Phase 2 ahead of dashboard work.

## Communication Cadence
- Daily 15â€‘minute stand-up (status, blockers, next steps).
- Weekly phase review with stakeholders to approve gate exit.
- Async updates in the project channel for merges, test failures, and release prep.

## Definition of Done
- All phase exit criteria satisfied, coverage target met, documentation published, and release artifacts built.
- Open issues triaged with follow-up owners; backlog ready for post-launch enhancements.

**Next Steps**
1. Save the AGENTS content into `AGENTS.md` at the repository root once write access is available.
2. Optional: place the helper script (for example `scripts/generate_agents.py`), adjust `render_agents` if you automate PRD parsing, and run it after enabling write permissions.
3. Begin Phase 1 setup tasks (`uv` install, project scaffolding) so the remaining milestones can proceed on schedule.
